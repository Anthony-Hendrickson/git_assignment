_I AM ADDING THIS TEXT TO DIFFERENTIATE THE README IN THE ASSIGNMENT BRANCH FROM THE MAIN BRANCH._
_I ACCIDENTALLY DID THIS ASSIGNEMNT BEFORE THE SHELL ASSIGNMENT._
_I MERGED INTO THE MAIN BRANCH THROUGH BASH AND THEN TOOK A BUNCH OF SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS AND I WILL NOT HAVE TIME TO UNDO THE CHANGES BEFORE THIS IS DUE._
_FOR THE SAKE OF THE ASSIGNMENT I HAVE TAKEN ALL OF THE NECESSARY STEPS TO COMPLETE THE TASK...AND WAY MORE WHICH, ALTHOUGH VALUABLE, I WOULD AVOID DOING NEXT TIME AROUND BECAUSE THEY WERE UNECESSARY AND THE RESULT OF MY OWN CONFUSION._

a. What is an issue?

_an issue in github is a way to communicate with collaborators, keep track of ideas, create new tasks or track bugs...it's whatever you want it to be it seems. In general it is kind of like a message board that can be used flexibly._

b. What is a pull request?

_A pull request is when a user makes modifications to a version of a file in a branch and asks for it to be merged into another branch, typically into the main branch._

c. How do I open up a pull request?

1. _Click on the "Pull request" near the top of the browser._
2. _Within this window click the green "New pull request" button._
3. _Identify the branch you are working on that you want to merge and the secondary branch you want to merge it into._
4. _Click the green "Create pull request" button_
5. _A page will open where you can provide a more elaborate description of the changes you made which will be incorporated into the secondary branch_
6. _Click the green "Create pull request" button_

d. Give me a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository.

1. _get the person's username_
2. _go to the landing page of your repository and click the "Settings" button with the cogwheel beside it._
3. _click the 'Collaborators' option in the sidebar to open the collaborators page_
4. _click the green 'Add People' button._
5. _search for the provided username and click the green "Add <username> to this repository" button_

_the specified user is sent an email with a request to join your repo_


e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?

_git is the software and GitHub is a web interface you can use to interact the software_

f. What does git diff do?

_git diff is a command used in bash that allows you to view the difference between two specified objects_

g. What is the main branch?

_the main branch is meant to contain the stable, peer reviewed and approved code. Best practices dictate that code is added to the main branch through creating pull requests and merging pull requests from secondary branches._

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?

_sometimes maybe for creating or making a modest change to the readme file where you have no collaborators maybe but in general no. That's a pretty hacky way to use github you might as well skip the hassle and just keep a file on your desktop._
